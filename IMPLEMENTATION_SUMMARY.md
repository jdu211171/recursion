## Key Features Implemented

1. **Multi-Tenancy**
   - Hierarchical structure: Organizations → Instances
   - Complete data isolation between tenants
   - Tenant context in all API operations

2. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - JWT-based authentication
   - Role-based access control (Admin, Staff, Borrower)
   - Refresh token mechanism

3. **Item Management**
   - Generalized for any item type
   - Unique ID generation
   - Support for multiple copies
   - Category organization

4. **Lending System**
   - Checkout/return workflows
   - Automatic penalty calculation
   - Dynamic blacklist system
   - Reservation management

5. **File Storage**
   - Secure file uploads with MinIO
   - Tenant-isolated buckets
   - File metadata tracking
   - Size and type validation

## Environment Variables Required

```env
# Database
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=secret
DB_NAME=borrowing_db

# JWT
JWT_SECRET=your-very-secure-jwt-secret-key-here
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=1h
JWT_REFRESH_EXPIRES_IN=7d

# Frontend
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173

# MinIO (for file storage)
MINIO_ROOT_USER=minioadmin
MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD=minioadmin
```

## Next Steps

1. **Testing**
   - Start Docker daemon
   - Run `docker-compose up`
   - Follow TESTING_GUIDE.md for integration tests

2. **Production Deployment**
   - Replace self-signed certificates with real ones
   - Configure production environment variables
   - Set up monitoring and logging
   - Implement CI/CD pipeline

3. **Enhancements**
   - Add email notifications
   - Implement advanced search
   - Add reporting dashboards
   - Mobile app development

## Development Commands

```bash
# Start all services
cd infrastructure
docker-compose up -d

# Start with development mode (hot reload)
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f [service-name]

# Stop all services
docker-compose down

# Rebuild specific service
docker-compose build [service-name]
```

## Known Issues

1. Docker daemon must be running before starting services
2. Frontend production build requires `npm run build` before containerization
3. SSL certificates need to be generated manually for HTTPS

## Conclusion

The multi-tenant borrowing/lending system is now fully implemented with a microservices architecture, ready for testing and deployment. All core features have been implemented following best practices for maintainability and scalability.
