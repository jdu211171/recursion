### By Default
**Sound cues** for success/error during borrow/return. (Reduces eyes-on-screen time for high-throughput desks.)

### For everyone (account-wide)

* **Profile basics**: Global name, avatar, language, timezone, date/time format, dark mode. (One global account model supports a single identity across Orgs.)
* **Security**: Change password, active sessions (sign out of others).
* **Default Instance** would be the last used Instance before logging out.
* **Disable sound cues** toggle (for those who prefer silence). (Sound cues are on by default, but can be turned off globally.)

### Role add-ons (only if you have the role)
**Admin** decide to enable/disable sound cues for all users in the Org. (Admins can override the global setting for their Org.)
