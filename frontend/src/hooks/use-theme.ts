/**
 * Dedicated hook file extracted from the previous inline definition inside theme-provider.tsx.

 * IMPORTANT:
 * For this hook to work, ensure that `ThemeProviderContext` is exported from

 *
 * Example adjustment in theme-provider.tsx (not done automatically here):
 *   export const ThemeProviderContext = createContext<ThemeProviderState>(initialState)
 *
 * This separation keeps the provider lean and allows the hook to be treeâ€‘shaken or
