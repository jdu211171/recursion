### 1. **User Management** (Critical Gap)
- No UI to view all users in organization

### 2. **Blacklist Management View**
- No dedicated blacklist table/view
- Can't see who's currently blacklisted

- No blacklist history or audit trail
- **Impact**: Staff can't check if user is blacklisted before lending

- No category usage statistics
- **Impact**: Categories can accumulate without cleanup

### 4. **File Management**

### 5. **Organization/Instance Management**

- **Impact**: Limited multi-tenant administration

### 6. **Reports/Analytics Dashboard**
