### **AI Coding Assistant Guidelines**

- **Tools**  
  - Use Bun for package management.  
  - Fix TypeScript errors with `bun run check-errors` after changes.

- **Code Changes**  
  - Modify only relevant code parts.  
  - Preserve formatting, names, and documentation unless specified.  
  - Output complete code if modified.

- **Project Management**  
  - Use TODO.md for tasks, progress, and issues. Update regularly.  
  - At session start: review TODO.md, run `git status`, check recent commits.

- **Git Practices**  
  - Work on main branch with conventional commits.  
  - Run pre-commit checks.  
  - Commit regularly with permission.

- **Development Process**  
  - Plan and discuss approaches before coding.  
  - Make small, testable changes.  
  - Eliminate duplicates.  
  - Log recurring issues in TODO.md.

- **Code Quality**  
  - Handle errors and validate inputs.  
  - Follow conventions and secure secrets.  
  - Write clear, type-safe code.  
  - Remove debug logs before production.

- **Documentation**  
  - Document code structure (components, API routes, utilities, types, assets).

- **Development Standards**  
  - Prioritize simplicity and readability.  
  - Start with minimal working functionality.  
  - Maintain consistent style.
