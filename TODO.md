  > Fix: Added `const apiClient = new ApiService('/api')` and `export default apiClient` to api.ts
  > Root cause: Newer services expected a default apiClient export that wasn't provided

✅ Fixed API call issues in feedback.ts (Completed 2025-08-04)
  ・ ✓ Removed incorrect `.data` references from API responses (lines 108, 114, 156)
  ・ ✓ Fixed getDevFeedback method to use fetch directly for custom headers
  ・ ✓ ApiService methods already return parsed response, not response object
  ・ ✓ Total fixes: 4 API calls corrected
  > Fix: Changed from `response.data` to direct return of API call results
  > Special case: getDevFeedback uses fetch directly since ApiService.get doesn't support custom headers
  > Root cause: Misunderstanding of ApiService return values which already parse JSON

✅ Fixed export/import issues in modal components (Completed 2025-08-04)
  ・ ✓ Updated FeedbackModal to use explicit type imports for CreateFeedbackData
  ・ ✓ Updated UserPreferencesModal to use explicit type imports for UserPreference, PreferenceOptions

  > Fix: Changed from mixed imports to separate default and type imports
  > Example: `import service, { Type }` → `import service` + `import type { Type }`
  > Root cause: Vite HMR caching issues with mixed default/named exports

✅ Fixed infinite loop in ItemFormModal (Completed 2025-08-04)
  ・ ✓ Moved initCustomFields function outside of useEffect
  ・ ✓ Wrapped function with useCallback to prevent recreation on every render
  ・ ✓ Removed initCustomFields from useEffect dependencies (was causing the loop)
  ・ ✓ Added check to only update form when modal is open
  ・ ✓ Error: "Maximum update depth exceeded" at line 95
  > Fix: initCustomFields creates new object each time, causing infinite updates
  > Solution: Dependencies changed to `[open, item]` only
  > Root cause: New object from initCustomFields triggered state updates in loop

  ・ ✓ Kept `/organizations/` endpoint for admin-only access

    - services/business-logic/eslint.config.js (line 27)
    - services/file-storage/eslint.config.js (line 27)

  > Result: Business logic service now starts successfully on port 3001
